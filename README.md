# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
This is a short web application developed to expose the user to the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user will also learn good habits using version control via Github. The user will gain familiarity with working locally and syncing to remote projects via the command line. 
Through the building of this project I learned the basic structure of a web application and various methods of styling that application. I bagan to learn some basic concepts of functions in JavaScript. The importance of robust documentation in the form of a README file was stressed and I made my first efforts at completing one.

## Usage

The app contains sections pertaining to the major topics covered in the prework. I placed notes of interest in each section. Moving forward the user can place more notes in each section for further review. The app can serve as a helpful tool in tracking material to review. Its template can be expanded to include new topics or copied to serve as a basis for other courses/interests. Using Chrome Developer Tools the user is given suggestions as to which topics to cover first via the console.
